        <p>Teddy is a maltipoo. He is three years old. He is the sweetest boy you'll ever meet and is the very
            definition of a lap dog. He is really tiny and only weighs eight pounds. Teddy is really friendly and is
            good with other animals and kids. He loves cuddles and mini milkbones!

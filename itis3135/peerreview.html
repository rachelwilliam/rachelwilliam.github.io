        <h4>CRAP Principles</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Contrast: I really like the green and yellow since it reminds me of actual wildflowers. The black text
                goes
                well with the other colors and really stands out.
            </li>
            <li>Repetition: The headings and navigation bar remain in the same spot on each page making it consistent.
            </li>
            <li>Alignment: The paragraphs, heading, and navigation bar are all left-aligned.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Everything is spaced out evenly.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I think this looks like a great project in the making.</p>

        <h3>Xie, Christina</h3>

        <h4>CRAP Principles</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Contrast: The light blue background makes the dark blue text pop.
            </li>
            <li>Repetition: The headings and navigation bar remain in the same spot on each page making it consistent.
            </li>
            <li>Alignment: The paragraphs, heading, and navigation bar are all left-aligned, so it looks good.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Everything is spaced out evenly except for some of the images towards the end of the picture
                gallery.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This looks like an impressive website. I think the blue theme compliments the colors of the succulents in the
            pictures well. I really like the slideshow on the homepage. The use of the
            accordion widget makes it look very professional.</p>

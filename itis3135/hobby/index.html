            <p>"Books are a uniquely portable magic." -Stephen King</p>
            <p>If I could spend all day reading (and there are days that I do), I would. I've loved reading ever
                since I
                picked up my first Junie B. Jones book in first grade. It is a really great hobby. I'm constantly
                expanding my vocabulary.
                It always blows my mind that words on a piece of paper can make you laugh, cry, or cringe (when the
                main character does something embarrassing).
                Here is some information about the benefits of reading and how to get started if you're interested.
                Hope you like them!</p>

            <h2>
                Best Times
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>There is never a wrong time to read. You can pick up a book at any time or any place. Sometimes I decide
                to finish
                a chapter and go to sleep. Next thing I know, it's 4 am and I would do it again! I'm the kind of person
                who always has
                a book in my bag, just in case. These are some of my
                favorite times to read:
            </p>
            <h4>Rainy Weather</h4>
            <p> Something about rainy weather makes me need a hot mug of coffee and a good book. Maybe it's just me, but
                the weather also tends to
                influence the genre that I want to read. I prefer to read mysteries or thrillers when it's storming.
            </p>
            <h4>Vacation</h4>
            <p>I go through as many books as possible when I'm on vacation. It's very relaxing to sit on the beach
                listening to the waves and read
                Colleen Hoover's new book.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>This picture is from my trip to the Smoky Mountains a couple years ago. I woke up really early to see the
                sunrise and decided to
                spend some time hearing the sounds of nature and reading a thriller by Mary Higgins Clark.

            <h2>
                Where
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>There are many places where you can find books. It depends on whether you want a physical copy or would
                prefer an ebook.
                A lot of people like to use kindles to read. I prefer reading physical books, but if I can't get a hold
                of one and I find an
                ebook, I don't mind.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <h4>Local libraries</h4>
            <p>I live in Harrisburg, NC, so the closest library to my house is the Cabarrus County Public Library. They
                have a large collection of
                books of every genre. Local library membership is free if you are a resident of the county. They also
                have many ebooks that can be
                accessed through an associated website.</p>

            <h4>Thrift Stores and Garage Sales</h4>
            <p>Yes, books aren't cheap and it really adds up when you go to a bookstore. I've gotten a lot of books for
                lower costs
                at garage sales and thrift stores. Second Look Books is a a second-hand book store that I go to often.
                It is a small family run
                business. It is also a great place to meet fellow bibliophiles.

            </figure>
            <h4>Brain Stimualation</h4>
            <p>Just like your body, it is important to exercise your brain. Reading keeps your brain active and
                stimulates it.
                This will help improve your memory. It is known to slow down diseases like Dementia and Alheimer's. It
                also improves
                your vocabulary.</p>
            <h4>Stress Reduction</h4>
            <p>Reading is very relaxing and is a great stress reliever. When you pick up a book, you are transported to
                a different world where all
                your worries are nonexistent. Depending on what you're reading, you can also find good advice and
                solutions to your problems.

            <p>My name is Rachel William. I'm a junior at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science with a
                concentration in Data Science.
                I was born and raised in a little town in California. I
                moved to Charlotte a couple of years ago. I love to bake, hike, and go on walks with my dog.</p>
            <p> One hobby that has stuck since I was a kid is
                reading. I love visiting libraries and finding books at thrift stores. Book stores always test my self
                control and I don't think I've ever left one without atleast one book in my hand.

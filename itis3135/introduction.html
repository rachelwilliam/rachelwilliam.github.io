                <strong>FUNNY/INTERESTING STORY:</strong> I got my wisdom teeth extracted last year. Before the anesthesia's effect took place,
                I told myself that I needed to thank everyone. I don't remember what happened when I came to, but my mom told me that 
                I thanked the dentist, nurses, and her about a hundred times!

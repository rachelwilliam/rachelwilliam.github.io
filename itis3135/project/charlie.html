        <p>Charlie is a miniature poodle. She is one and a half years old. She is an extremely friendly and energetic little girl.
            Charlie loves to go on walks and play fetch. She loves the great outdoors! Since she is so active, it would be best if she 
            goes to a home with a yard.

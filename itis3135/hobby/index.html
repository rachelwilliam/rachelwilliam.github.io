            <p>If I could spend all day reading (and there are days that I do), I would. I've loved reading ever since I

                Best Times
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>There is never a wrong time to read. You can pick up a book at any time or any place. Sometimes I decide
                to finish
                a chapter and go to sleep. Next thing I know, it's 4 am and I would do it again! These are some of my
                favorite times to read:
            </p>
            <h4>Rainy Weather</h4>
            <p> Something about rainy weather makes me need a hot mug of coffee and a good book. Maybe it's just me, but
                the weather also tends to
                influence the genre that I want to read. I prefer to read mysteries or thrillers when it's storming.
            </p>
            <h4>Vacation</h4>
            <p>I go through as many books as possible when I'm on vacation. It's very relaxing to sit on the beach
                listening to the waves and read
                Colleen Hoover's new book.</p>

            <figcaption>Reading on vacation</figcaption>
            <p>This picture is from my trip to the Smoky Mountains a couple years ago. I woke up really early to see the
                sunrise and decided to
                spend some time hearing the sounds of nature and reading a thriller by Mary Higgins Clark.

            <p>My name is Rachel William. I'm a junior at UNC Charlotte. One hobby that has stuck since I was a kid is
                reading.
                I love visiting libraries and finding books at thrift stores. Book stores always test my self control
                and I don't
                think I've ever left one without atleast one book in my hand.

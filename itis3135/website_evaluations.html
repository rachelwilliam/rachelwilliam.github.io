        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
            CRAP Principles:
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Repetition</li>
            <li>Alignment</li>
            <li>Proximity</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Good Example: <a href="https://www.drpepper.com/s/" target="_blank">Dr. Pepper</a></h3>
        This website has information about Dr. Pepper, a carbonated drink.
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Good contrast using black and various shades of red with white text.</li>
            <li>Repetition: The home page is very minimalistic. The position of the links alternate.</li>
            <li>Alignment: There are three distinct sections that have the same size and alignment.</li>
            <li>Proximity: The different sections are equidistant.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Bad Example: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news" target="_blank">BBC News</a></h3>
        This website shares the news.
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Good contrast using red, gray, and black. The images used also provide a lot of contrast
                against the white background.</li>
            <li>Repetition: There are a lot of pictures of different sizes on the website and some of them are not using the same alignment which makes it a bit unpleasant to look at.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Some of the news articles are different sizes skewing the alignment.</li>
            <li>Proximity: There are a lot of articles all really close together.</li>
        </ul>

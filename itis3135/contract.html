            <h2>Course Contract</h2>
            <p>
                I, Rachel R. William agree to abide by the
                terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS3135, Web
                Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I.
                von Briesen.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools
                will be available to the world, and will not put information there that
                is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
                logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
                may show as absences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
                it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates'
                code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
                and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given
                credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
              </p>

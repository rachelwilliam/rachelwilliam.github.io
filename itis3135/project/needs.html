        <h2>Basic Needs</h2>
        <div id="accordion">

            <h3><a href="#accordion-1">Food</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>Since Charlie, Teddy, and Echo are small dogs, they do not eat a lot. It is important to give them
                    tasty kibble that provides all the nutrients that they need. Their favorite treats are Dentastix,
                    Milk Bones, and Cheerios.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Charlie</strong>: 3/4 cup of Blue Buffalo dog food, twice a day (morning and evening)</p>
                <p><strong>Teddy</strong>: 1/4 cup of Blue Buffalo dog food, twice a day (morning and evening)</p>
                <p><strong>Echo</strong>: 1/4 cup of Blue Buffalo dog food, twice a day (morning and evening)</p>
            </div>

            <h3><a href="#accordion-2">Exercise</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>Exercise plays a big part in keeping dogs healthy. Dog owners tend to be more active, so this is a
                    win-win!</p>
                <p><strong>Charlie</strong>: 10 minute run in the morning, 15 minute walk or 10 minute run in the
                    evening, and 10 minutes of fetch outside</p>
                <p><strong>Teddy</strong>: 15 minute walk in the morning, 15 minute walk in the evening, and fetch</p>
                <p><strong>Echo</strong>: 10 minute walk in the morning, 10 minute walk in the evening, and fetch till
                    he wants to go back inside</p>
            </div>

            <h3><a href="#accordion-3">Grooming</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>Charlie, Teddy, and Echo are hypoallergenic breeds, which means that they do not shed for the most
                    part! However, they are also considered to be high-maintenance breeds. Deb currently takes them to
                    the PetSmart closest to her house to get them groomed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Charlie</strong>: groom once every 6-8 weeks, bathe once every 3 weeks, and brush every day</p>
                    <p><strong>Teddy</strong>: groom once a month, bathe once every 2-3 weeks, and brush every 2-3 days</p>
                    <p><strong>Echo</strong>: groom once every 6-8 weeks, bathe once every 3 weeks, and brush every day</p>
